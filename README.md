# Kawaii Physics SB - Kawaii Physics for Stellar Blade

## Description
This is a custom fork of Kawaii Physics built for modding Stellar Blade. By default Kawaii Physics doesn't work with Stellar Blade because of the new properties they added to the main node. This fork adds dummy values so custom physics can be modded into the game.
